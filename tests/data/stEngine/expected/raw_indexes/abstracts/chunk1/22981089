The autopsy findings of a 30-year-old woman who died of cerebral hemorrhage induced by bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma are presented. The cerebral hemorrhage was shown on the left cerebral hemisphere widely. Her both adrenal glands were severe swelling, and their parenchyma was occupied by a dark red-brown tumorous positive for chromogranin A. The serum catecholamine and their metabolite, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) levels were markedly high. Furthermore, cardiac hypertrophy and sclerosis of the arteries of various organs had progressed, suggesting an influence of persistent endocrinal hypertension. The measurement of serum VMA level was thought to be valuable for a postmortem diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma may have excessively secreted catecholamine and subsequently caused secondary hypertension, leading to cerebral hemorrhage.
