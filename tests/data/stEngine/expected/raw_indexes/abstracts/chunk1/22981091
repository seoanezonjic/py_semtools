Short nucleotide polymorphism in ERCC5 (rs751402), a key molecule in DNA damage repair, was analyzed in 575 individuals who were either control subjects with no clinical evidence of malignant transformation of the oral mucosa or subjects with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).

All participants provided a blood sample, demographic data, and information on habitual use of tobacco, alcohol, and areca nut.

rs751402 homozygocity for C allele was found to confer a statistically significant protection against OSCC (adjusted odds ratio 0'56, 95% confidence interval 0'35-0'89; P = .01), whereas rs751402 T alleles were associated with increased risk.

Our findings suggest that there is an association between rs751402 polymorphism and incidence of oral cancer. ERCC rs751402 CC genotype is significantly associated with decreased risk of OSCC, whereas the T allotype is correlated with higher risk of OSCC.
